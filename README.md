## Resume-e or CV
#### I got bored of writing my personal letters so I created a system.

[![Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github_Actions-181717.svg?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white&logo=github)]()
</div>

Basically my CV is written with the following system
```
____________________________
CV SECTION
 TITLE
 EXPERIENCE
 PROJECTS
 EDUCATION
 OTHER INFO

PERONAL LETTER
 INTRODUCTION - ABOUT & HISTORY
 PERSONAL PARAGRAPH DEPENDING ON JOB
 OUTRO
```

When I add a personal paragraph for a job, I push my changes and the Github Actions compiles all my CVs to a zip file which I can download.

This means my CVs get organized and centralied.

EDIT: I have now decided to split my personal letters and cv, these are now different files and in their respective directories.
