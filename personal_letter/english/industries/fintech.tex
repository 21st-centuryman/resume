I have had a deep interest in analytical structures and finance. From my time at Nasdaq, SEB, KTH Blockchain society and my own experience running my own consultancy, I find myself especially wanting to work with the backend operations within fintech to help modernize this industry from legacy code that run all over the finance industry. Therefore I believe I could bring great value to Qliro, to create secure and efficient code, to help create the day to day (or the day to pay later) transactions possible.
