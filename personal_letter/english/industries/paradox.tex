I hope I have shown that I have a deep interest in devops, software engineering, and the tech stack in general. I would love to use my current experience to imporve or create a product that I personally use. As a massive history, politics and philosophy buff, I am naturally a massive fan of games like Hearts of Iron IV and Cities skylines (I am aware you publish the latter). Using my experience with hardware from AWS, (as well as my personal homelab) and my CI/CD and python experience from Nasdaq, I feel that I would be a great fit to improve and test paradox products as well as their internal tools. Long story short I am a massive fan of Paradox's games. I would love to improve it in any way I can.
