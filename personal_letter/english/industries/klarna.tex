I hope I have shown that I have a deep interest in devops, software engineering, and the tech stack in general. I would love to use my current experience to improve the experience of users using the Klarna ecosystem. As a person who is very interested in finance and its relationship with technology I want to use  my backend, QA and devops experience to improve the minute by minute performance, security, and reliability of your systems. As an avid user of your systems I have some issues and improvements I would love to make to your app.  Using TDD and my experience using Typescript, React, Docker, QA technologies, and Node at Nasdaq I feel that I am a great fit to achieve that for Klarna.
Long story short I am a massive fan of Klarna's ecosystem and want to improve it in any way I can, to help build the future of finance.
