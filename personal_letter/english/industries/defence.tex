I have had a deep interest in cybersecurity and defence. From my time at Amazon and Nasdaq I have worked first hand with testing and making sure the hardware/software works and is build correctly for small and major releases.On another, more personal note, I have family whom have served in the Swedish armed forces. I've always wanted to help work with defence in the best capacity I could provide. I believe I can bring great value to SAAB as a systems engineer helping build secure, tested, proven software for the defence of tomorrow.
