YEA REWRITE THIS TOO
I have had a deep interest in analytical structures and finance. Being quite active in KTH AI society i find myself reading books at SEB trying to learn how to analyze and predict market trends. Therefore I believe I can bring great value to Nasdaq as a QA analysis helping create a more open and transparent market, while also helping clients navigate these confusing waters. Helping me make this hobby into a career.
