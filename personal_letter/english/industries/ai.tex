I have a deep interest in AI, from a low-level hardware and software perspective. As of writing this, I am currently working on my thesis which will be about me rewriting an algorithm from stable-baselines3 from PyTorch to a new framework called Tinygrad. The thesis will focus on the hardware instructions that are used and how we can minimize the usage of branching which accounts for the vast majority of complexity in a CPU and GPU. I want to therefore continue this journey in AI to minimize the complexity of these systems, after all our brains use only 20W of power.
