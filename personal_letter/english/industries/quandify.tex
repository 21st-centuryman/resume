I hope I have shown that I have a deep interest in devops, software engineering, and the tech stack in general. I would love to use my current experience to imporve or create a product that makes an impact. I would love to use my backend, QA and devops experience to improve the minute by minute performance, security, and reliability of your systems. I spend the majority of my time tinkering with low level systems (mainly using rust), or working on my own self-hosted software suite. On top of this I have used AWS, Terraform, QA, Typescript, and Node while working for AWS and Nasdaq. Using these skills I would love to start working on a low-level product and sustainability. Long story short I am a massive fan of Quandify's product and mission. I want to improve it in any way I can, to help build the future of sustainable living.
