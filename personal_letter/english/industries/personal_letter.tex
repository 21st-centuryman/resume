I hope I have been able to make clear my deep interest in devops, software engineering and networking. I would have loved the opportunity to use my current experience and blinding to build the technology of tomorrow. With my backend, QA and devops experience I would like to improve the performance, security and reliability minute by minute of your systems. With my experience at AWS, I think I could also focus on improving the experience with AWS or other google services to improve your software suite.
