I have had a deep interest in analytical structures and finance. From my time at Nasdaq, SEB, KTH Blockchain society and my own experience running my own consultancy, I find myself especially wanting to work with the continus integration operations within fintech to help modernize this industry from infrastructure and processes that hold it back. With my experience with AWS and other CI/CD technologies I believe I can bring great value to Nordnet, to help build and expand the payment solutions of tomorrow.
